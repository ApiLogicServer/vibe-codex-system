Big Vision: GenAI Makes It Attainable
-------------------------------------

As AI accelerates change, business agility has never been more important. Our IT systems must keep up:

> It Should Be As Simple to Create a System as It Is to Imagine It

And with GenAI, we are tantalizingly close. A number of Vibe tools now create complete multi-page user interfaces, and their evaluations reflect the potential impact.

Big Problem: Buggy GenAI FrankenCode
------------------------------------

But that impact is held up by a big problem:

*   Nearly half the effort in an IT system is the backend â€” the logic, the integration.
*   But GenAI technology â€” _on its own_ â€” turns a simple 5 line logic requirement into 200 lines of FrankenCode. And itâ€™s buggy.
*   And even if it worked, you really donâ€™t want it. Itâ€™s like have to debug and maintain the byte code of your compiler.

> We want to maintain the **high level of abstraction** of natural language.

Big Solution: Declarative GenAI
-------------------------------

So, this means:

*   We should _not_ be asking GenAI to explode our 5 lines of logic into 200 lines of procedural code.
*   We _should_ be asking GenAI to translate our 5 lines of logic into rigorous, executable code at the same level of abstraction â€” just executable. Thatâ€™s **_Declarative GenAI._**

Itâ€™s unique to GenAI-Logic. And it looks like this:

Declarative GenAI translates 5 lines of logic into 5 lines of executable code, executable via the Declarative Rules Engine. NOT 200 lines of FrankenCode.

> This is the missing half of GenAI, enabling it to close the adoption gap for GenAI. For more on Declarative GenAI, [click here.](https://medium.com/@valjhuber/the-missing-half-of-genai-and-why-microsofts-ceo-says-it-s-the-future-c6fc05d93640)

Big Impact: Organizational Business Agility
-------------------------------------------

> _This is more than developer productivity. Itâ€™s_ organizational business agility: _business and IT collaborating on systems that can evolve as fast as the business itself_.
> 
> _Unlike traditional low-code tools that often pit business users against IT, GenAI-Logic enables true collaboration â€” business users draft, IT refines, and the system stays governable._ We can now:

1.  Enable Business Users to **_create first draft systems in minutes_**, iterate them to get the requirements right, and (as required) turn it over to IT to finish it off.

First Draft of a System â€” this runs, ready to collaborate / iterate to get requirements right

This creates an executable system system in about a minute:

Developers can use Vibe to create Custom User Interfaces

2\. Enable IT to add MCP support â€” including logic â€” to existing databases, which in turn enables Business Users to compose their own services that adhere to organizational policies.

> Both scenarios depend on Declarative GenAI logic, unique to GenAI-Logic.

Proviso: No Automation Tax
--------------------------

OKâ€¦ but to get this technology, we should not be required to lose the value of our existing tools and methodologies. Achieving the full potential requires it should leverage our existing IDEs (such as [Copilot](https://medium.com/@valjhuber/vibe-with-copilot-and-genai-logic-925894574125)), source code management, testing, deployment, monitoring, etc.
